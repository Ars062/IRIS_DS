🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project
This is a classic data science and machine learning project based on the Iris Flower Dataset. It focuses on data analysis, visualization, and classification of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.

📁 Repository Contents
Iris.csv — The raw dataset containing labeled features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) for different iris species.

Iris_flower.ipynb — A Jupyter Notebook that includes data exploration, visualization, and a classification model built using machine learning algorithms.

📊 Project Objectives
Explore and visualize the features of the Iris dataset.

Build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

Evaluate the model using accuracy metrics and visual tools like confusion matrix.

🔍 Key Features
📉 EDA: Exploratory data analysis including pair plots and histograms.

🧠 ML Modeling: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree classifiers.

🎯 Model Evaluation: Accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

🛠️ Data Preprocessing: Handling categorical labels and scaling features.

📦 Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

💡 Insights
The features of iris flowers are highly separable, especially between Setosa and the other species.

Simple machine learning models can achieve >95% accuracy on this dataset.

KNN and Decision Tree classifiers performed especially well in classifying the species.
