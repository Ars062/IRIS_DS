# IPL Match Data Analysis

This project involves a detailed analysis of Indian Premier League (IPL) match data. The aim is to explore, clean, and derive meaningful insights from the raw data using Python and its data science libraries.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `matches.csv`: This is the **raw dataset** containing IPL match-level data. It includes match dates, teams, venues, outcomes, and more.
- `IPL.ipynb`: This is the **TNV (Python Copy) Jupyter Notebook** that includes all the data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. The notebook walks through each step of the data pipeline including loading, cleaning, exploration, and summary insights.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Understand key trends and patterns in IPL match outcomes.
- Identify winning patterns of teams and performance trends over the years.
- Perform basic statistical analysis and visual exploration.
- Build a clean and reproducible data analysis pipeline in Python.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis

## 📈 Key Highlights

- Visual breakdown of team performance.
- Analysis of toss decisions vs match outcomes.
- Venue-wise performance and winning statistics.
- Seasonal comparison of matches and team statistics.
